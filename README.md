# Meta-Learning applied to Process Mining

> Application of Meta-learning to recommend a suitable process discovery method that maximizes model quality in four complementary dimensions: fitness, precision, generalization and simplicity. According to our Meta-learning pipeline, it is possible to recommend a discovery method with 92% of accuracy using light-weight meta-features from the Process Mining domain.

## Installation

### Clone

Clone this repo to your local machine using

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gbrltv/process_meta_learning.git
```

To directly use meta feature extraction methods via `import`
```shell
cd process_meta_learning
pip install -e .
```

## Experimental Setup

### Data preparation


Before running the experiments, it is necessary to convert the original logs (`xes.gz`) to the `xes` format (entropy extraction does not accept `xes.gz` files). For that, run:

```shell
python3 convert_log_files.py
```

This code converts files under the `event_logs` folder and removes the original files.


### Extracting Meta-features

To extract the meta-features from event logs, simply run the following line of code:

```shell
python3 extract_features.py
```

The meta-features are saved under the `results` folder with the name `log_features.csv`.


### Model Quality Metrics

To compute model quality metrics (fitness, precision, generalization, simplicity), run the following code:


```shell
python3 model_metrics.py
```

The quality metrics (along with their computation time) are saved under the `results` folder with the name `model_metrics.csv`.

### Evaluating Results

For an in-depth analysis of results, classification performance, model relevance, and quality metrics, please take a look [here](https://github.com/gbrltv/process_meta_learning/blob/main/evaluation.ipynb).
